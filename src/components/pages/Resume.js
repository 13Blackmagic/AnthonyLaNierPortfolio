        I worked for Walgreens for nine years. I started as a cashier and worked <br/>
        my way up to a shift lead. I was in charge of the store when the <br/>
        manager was not there. I was in charge of the employees and the <br/>
        customers. I was in charge of the money and the safe. I was in charge of <br/>
        the store. I was in charge of the store when the manager was not there. <br/>
        Then I became an assistant manager and I was in that position for four and a helf years. <br/>
        Then I became a manager and I was in that position for a year before I wanted to become a web developer. <br/>
